# Calculator at home
A mini-project for exploring compiler construction by implementing a simple compiler for a basic arithmetic language. This project aims to provide insights into the fundamental concepts of programming language implementation, including lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation.

## Run the Compiler:
You might need to modify the user priviliges to be able to execute it
```bash
chmod u+x compiler.py
```

To interpret an arithmetic expression:
```bash
./compiler.py -i program_name.calc
```
To compile an arithmetic expression:
```bash
./compiler.py -c program_name.calc
```
